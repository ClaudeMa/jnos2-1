 People have asked me to put JNOS 2.0 sources on github, so here you go.

 The official JNOS 2.0 site will always be :

 The 2.0n (and 2.0n.beta) work has been shelved, in favour of just going
 back to 2.0m and at some point releasing a JNOS 2.0 security kit, which
 people can slap on top of any 2.0m or later release. Unfortunately, the
 the 2.0n release was simply getting out of hand, and too complicated.
